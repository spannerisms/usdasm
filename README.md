# A Link to the Past US Disassembly
Full disassembly of the US version of the game.

---

## Completeness
This disassembly compiles exactly to the US version. To assemble this code, use the included `_build.bat`. A special-made version of Asar with a pooling feature for sublabel management is included in the repository as `asarmon.exe`.

This was built and converted from the [JP1.0 disassembly](https://github.com/spannerisms/jpdasm); however, minimal effort will be made to keep them in sync.

## Binaries
Raw binaries are not included in this repository. For reassembling, you will need to extract that data from your own US ROM and create the `bin` directory with those files included.

An accurate assembly of this repository should have the following checksums:
* Internal (complement): `AF0D` (`50F2`)
* CRC32: `777AAC2F`
* MD5: `608c22b8ff930c62dc2de54bcd6eba72`
* SHA1: `6D4F10A8B10E10DBE624CB23CF03B88BB8252973`
